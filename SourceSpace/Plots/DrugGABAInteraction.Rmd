<b>This is an R Markdown document. This contains a workflow for reproducing the results and plots obtained in the following publication:</b>

-   Perry, A., Hughes, L., Adams, N., Naessens, M., Murley, A., Rouse, M., ... & Rowe, J. (2022). The neurophysiological effect of NMDA-R antagonism of frontotemporal lobar degeneration is conditional on individual GABA concentration. *In review, Translational Psychiatry*

<br>

<b>The report produces the two main results from the paper, which are:</b>

1.  No differential influence of memantine on MEG responses across control individuals and persons with bvFTD/PSP

2.  Responses to drug in bvFTD/PSP persons are conditional on GABA concentration in frontal cortex

<br>

### 1) Group differences in drug response

For simplicity purposes, we will just report the responses in one region (auditory cortex).

```{r} setwd("/Users/alistairperry/Documents/Cambridge/Project/Analysis/LFPs/newmaxfilter_icafixes/LFPs_COH_wrad_allMEGch_wfids/C_Plots/DrugAnalysis")}



```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
