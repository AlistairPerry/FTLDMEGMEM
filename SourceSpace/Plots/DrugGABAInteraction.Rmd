<b>This is an R Markdown document. This contains a workflow for reproducing the results and plots obtained in the following publication:</b>

-   Perry, A., Hughes, L., Adams, N., Naessens, M., Murley, A., Rouse, M., ... & Rowe, J. (2022). The neurophysiological effect of NMDA-R antagonism of frontotemporal lobar degeneration is conditional on individual GABA concentration. *In review, Translational Psychiatry*

<br>

<b>The report produces the two main results from the paper, which are:</b>

1.  No differential influence of memantine on MEG responses across control individuals and persons with bvFTD/PSP

2.  Responses to drug in bvFTD/PSP persons are conditional on GABA concentration in frontal cortex

<br>

### 1) Group differences in drug response

For simplicity purposes, we will just report the responses in one region (auditory cortex).

First load required packages (ensure they are installed)

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rstatix)
```

<br>

```{r}
#Load data
setwd("/Users/alistairperry/Documents/Cambridge/Project/Analysis/LFPs/newmaxfilter_icafixes/LFPs_COH_wrad_allMEGch_wfids/C_Plots/DrugAnalysis")

datfname<-"LFP_RAud_MMNmean_rep3_ConsandPats_DrugInt.txt"

MMNtab <- read.delim(datfname)

#And print out
print(MMNtab)
```

<br>

Note, data needs to be in long format..

```{r}
#You will need ID as a column
ID <- rep(seq(1,nrow(MMNtab)),1)
MMNtab_wID <- data.frame(ID, MMNtab)

#Now convert to long format
MMNtab_long <- MMNtab_wID %>% gather(drug, MMN, meanMMNcol_PLA:meanMMNcol_MEM, factor_key = TRUE)

#Ensure ID and drug session vars are factors
MMNtab_long$ID <- as.factor(MMNtab_long$ID)
MMNtab_long$drug <- as.factor(MMNtab_long$drug)
```

<br>

We can now run our statistical analysis, with a 2x2 mixed ANOVA used to assess differential group responses to drug - here we set *group* as between-subjects and *drug session* the within-subjects factor:

```{r}
# Two-way mixed ANOVA test
res.aov <- anova_test(
  data = MMNtab_long, dv = MMN, wid = ID,
  between = Group, within = drug
  )
get_anova_table(res.aov)
```

<br>

From the output above, we find the *group x drug* interaction is non-significant (*p*=0.163), and hence can conclude that memantine does not have a differential group effect in the right auditory cortex.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
