# FTLD, MEG, and MEMANTINE

This repository contains processing, analysis, and visualisation scripts that were performed in the following paper:

* Perry, A., Hughes, L., Adams, N., Naessens, M., Murley, A., Rouse, M., ... & Rowe, J. (2022). The neurophysiological effect of NMDA-R antagonism of frontotemporal lobar degeneration is conditional on individual GABA concentration. Available as preprint at https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1609477/v1


This study investigated the influence of the pharmacological agent memantine on frontotemporal brain networks in persons with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).
